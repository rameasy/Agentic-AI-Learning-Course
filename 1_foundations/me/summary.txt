My name is Ramachandran Subramanian. I'm a software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Coimbatore, India, but I moved to United Kingdom in 2019.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
